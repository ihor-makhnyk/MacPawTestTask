Here is my Enemy Losses application. For more visual preview, check the presentation in repository.
Created logo in Photoshop, though other images are iOS based system images.

**Demonstrated technologies:**
- SwiftUI
- UIKit
- Combining storyboards with SwiftUI views
- MVVM
- JSON parsing using URL Sessions
- Simple algorithms
- Localized srtings
- Reusable models

*On 26.07 made a minor fix: reversed list appearance, to see latest info first and commented out two yet useless lines of code in DateFormatter.*

**To Do list before publishing to App Store:**
- Complete full localisation.
- Optimise the app to support iPads.
- Create notification alerts about new day data updates.
- Create a ‘search by date’ bar.
- Add donation link in settings ( for “ЗСУ”, “Повернись Живим”, etc.).
- Create algorithmic web parser to update the list every day.
- Create a fancy graph and statistics with destroyed equipment.
- Improve Day Info Page appearance.
- Create more customisable settings.
- Complete error handling work.
- Group the main list by month folders.
